"""
Because of difficulty of exporting political-news-filter
(https://github.com/lukasgebhard/Political-News-Filter)
as a package to be run anywhere, I do exploration using that script
in C:\Users\tlebr\OneDrive - pku.edu.cn\Thesis\polinews\polinews\section_poc.py.
See that script for information about scmp section eda, where we verify that
we're getting mostly news articles on recent years. 
. 

Random note: sections are robust by 2013, but 2011 & 2012 data is sketchy.
